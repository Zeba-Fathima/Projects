Hello Everyone!!
I am Zeba Fathima
I am currently a computer Science Student
This repository basically contains the projects that I have done 

So the projects are:

1.LMS-Library Management System using Postgress SQL 

2.CrimeRecordManagement- It contains the java code for managing the crime records such as displaying the crime records , adding a new crime record, removing a crime record,searching a crime through its id , Deleting a crime .This code contains all the concepts of java like clas,object,abstract class,non-abstarct class,inteface,abstract and non-abstract methods,super and this keywords,inheritance,exceptional handling,method-overloading,method-overriding,access modifiers,scanner to take input,collection class. 

3.ADS- Downloaded the map for a small area using OSMnx, and write your custom formula to find a path between two nodes and plot it.(Yet to do - optimise problem, implementing querying to find the nearest hospital to your home, and calculating the time take to get there)

4.Travel Website - So basically people find difficulty in finding the places to visit,hotels they can stay at that places,so my concept is to develop a website which can provide with both the details in one website.
